# Qt-SymmetricCryptography
This is my course project on Cryptography Methods course. Here you can find emplementation of GOST 28147-89 and GOST 34.12-2018 symmetric cryptografy algorithms in modes from GOST 34.11-2018. To run this programm you need Qt Framework with minGW 5.12.3 compiler (or you can write me and I will send you desktop version:).
